## Join our open-source project! :muscle:

### Motivation for open-source

This is a **beginner-friendly** open-source project aimed for **social good**. We are always looking for more passionate individuals, like you, to contribute!

Open-source project is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption and collaboration, allowing people to spread and improve projects quickly. It also is a perfect place for anyone to hone their skills and share their visions and ideas with like-minded others. Here are three major reasons as to why you should contribute to our open-source project!

- **Collaboration**: Open-source project can accept changes from anyone in the world.
- **Adoption**: Open source project can be used by anyone for nearly any purpose.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors and making small and big improvements.

If you are still confused about the concept of open source and would like to learn more, check out the [**Github's official guide!**](https://github.com/open-source)

### Sharing for social good

I am a firm believer that a personal project is **so much more meaningful** if it brings positive impact to the society.

I have always been in awe of people who strive to make a change in the world. The philanthropists and activists on the television, in interviews, and in books inspire me with their radiating passion for what they stand for, and I used to hope that one day I could be passionate enough about something to also create change in the world.

And now, here I am, launching **the first open-source project here on Github**. This is an opportunity for people to connect with others who share the same drive for creating positive changes around us.

### It can be overwhelming

I remember the first time I tried to make contribution to an open-source. The experience was quite overwhelming. There were so many things I did not understand about the project, and I couldn't even understand the command lines that were used for setting up the project.

Even now, I am by no means an experienced person. There's still so much I am learning everyday. One of my regrets I had along the way was failing to discover the best available resources. Somehow in my mind, I always thought that I need to be someone to be able to contribute. But **THAT IS TOTALLY NOT THE CASE**. All you need is a heart to contribute, a willpower that drives you forward, even after failure, and a faith that you will succeed if you keep at it.

I want to make sure your experience here is a **positive, friendly, and exciting one**. Together we can foster a loving community for learners.

### Join us!

I would **really really encourage you to fork and use this project in whatever way you want. Let's keep spreading love during this challenging time.**

Once you join our project and make your first contribution, you will be listed as one of our **contributors** and add your profile in our [**README.md section**](#Open-source-Team). I truly believe that working on an open-source project will make you a better person and communicator, and it will also give you something meaningful to talk about when you talk to a recruiter (if you are going to industry in the future)!

Whether it is because of your **passion for social good**, or your desire to **share something with world**, or simply to find an opportunity to **gain some experiences with github**, we would love to have you.

- If you have any hesitations, questions, or concerns. Feel free to [**send me a email**](mailto:sameerkatija@gmail.com). Happy to connect!
